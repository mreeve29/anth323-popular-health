                    Consider the following population where each member is colored gray, representing an uninfected and

                    Now imagine ~75% of the population were vaccinated (blue) against the red strain of the virus. See
                    how the virus spreads now:

                    High vaccination rates provide a 'wall' of immunity to those who are not vaccinated, note how some
                    unvaccinated members remain uninfected
                </p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                    Now let's create a population with a ~99% vaccination rate, all but one member is vaccinated against
                    the red strain.
                </p>

                    What happened? The only unvaccinated member contracted the original strain of the virus and then the
                    virus mutated into a more contagious and immune-evasive version (now in green). The prior
                    vaccination is not effective at preventing green-strain infection. As a result, all members are
                    infected regardless of their vaccination status, similar to the first scenario.
                </p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                    This is a small scale example, however it highlights the importance of high vaccination rates. All
                    it takes is one person to cause a virus to mutate into one that can avoid prior immunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have seen this outcome throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The Omicron variant was discovered after
                    vaccines had become mainstream. If everyone in the world was vaccinated, COVID-19 would have had a
                    much smaller chance to mutate into something like Omicron.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vaccine distribution is not equal across the globe, however. Not only do wealthy nations need to
                    distribute vaccines to lower-income regions but they also need to educate those populations on the
                    importance of vaccinations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you live in the United States you are lucky enough to have free, uncontested access to most
                    mainstream vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines. Do your part and get vaccinated, as well as the
                    updated Bivalent booster which targets Omicron variants of COVID-19.
