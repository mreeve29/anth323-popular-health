                    High vaccination rates provide a 'wall' of immunity to those who are not vaccinated, note how some
                    unvaccinated members remain uninfected
                </p>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    Now let's create a population with a ~99% vaccination rate, all but one member is vaccinated against
                    the red strain.

                    What happened? The only unvaccinated member contracted the original strain of the virus and then the
                    virus mutated into a more contagious and immune-evasive version (now in green). The prior
                    vaccination is not effective at preventing green-strain infection. As a result, all members are
                    infected regardless of their vaccination status, similar to the first scenario.
                </p>
                <hr />

                <p>
                    The individualistic mindset to not get vaccinated cost the population's herd immunity. The promotion
                    of vaccination and prevention measures from governments is often inconsistent, leading the community
                    to lose trust and rely on political figures for their information. Elected officials want to retain
                    their office and preserve approval ratings from their community. This creates a dynamic where a
                    virus and vaccines become political, and where individuals make blunt decisions, disregarding the
                    health of the general public.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is a small scale example, however it highlights the importance of high vaccination rates. All
                    it takes is one person to cause a virus to mutate into one that can avoid prior immunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have seen this outcome throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The Omicron variant was discovered after
                    vaccines had become mainstream. If everyone in the world was vaccinated, COVID-19 would have had a
                    much smaller chance to mutate into something like Omicron.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vaccine distribution is not equal across the globe, however. Wealthier countries are better equipped
                    to handle new waves of COVID-19 because of their relatively high vaccination rates. In contrast,
                    in-development countries have less access to vaccines because of costs.
                </p>
                <img id="nyt-img" src="anth_pics/nyt.png" />
                <p>
                    Not only do wealthy nations need to distribute vaccines to lower-income regions but they also need
                    to educate those populations on the importance of vaccinations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you live in the United States you are lucky enough to have free, uncontested access to most
                    mainstream vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines. Do your part and get vaccinated, as well as
                    receive the updated Bivalent booster which targets Omicron variants of COVID-19.
